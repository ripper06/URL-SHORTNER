//To hand server side ui rendering we have some template engines
//like : EJS, handlebars, pug

//Authentication

//Stateful Auth-  

 CLIENT    -------username/password------------> SERVER
uid: 367   <----------session uid---------------

(Client login with uname ans password server matches it and generate an unique user id for client)
(That uid is stored in server)
(Then that uid is sent to client as response)

CLIENT  ---------- GET/users | uid : 367 -------> SERVER
        <---------- response : all users --------
(For next req client sent that uid with subsequent request)
(Server validate that uid if that exists and eligible to have access)
(On sucessful validation and authorisation res is sent)

How uid is sent from client to server ?
1- Cookies - EJS(Browsers)
2- response
3- Headers - REST API

EXPRESS FLOW :

CLIENT-------->AUTH MIDDLEWARE--------->END POINT ROUTE

AUTH MIDDLEWARE - chexks for cookie value or uid, if valid calls next() else reject the request

//Stateless -
